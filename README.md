# Cryptography Scripts 

This folder contains various cryptography scripts and notes. 
I'm interested in creating a tool that allows the user to 
encrypt messages using historical ciphers. Who knows, it 
might be cool to end up making a TUI version of the tool
that is actually interactive. For now, though, I think 
I'm just going to work on writing some ciphers, taking
notes on the history of those ciphers and compiling them
into a simple and easy CLI.
